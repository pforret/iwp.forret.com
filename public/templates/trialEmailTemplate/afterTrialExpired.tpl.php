Hey <?php echo $d['firstName']; ?>,<br><br>

First up, thanks a lot for taking the time to try out InfiniteWP and I hope it was worth it. I can see that you have not subscribed to any Premium plan yet. And thatâ€™s perfectly alright. May be the free features sufficed your needs.<br><br>

In 2 days, we will permanently delete your instance of IWP. If you would like to continue using it, you have to <a>move your panel</b>immediately.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
David.<br><br>

P.S.: As always, if you have any questions, just reply to this email and we'll get back to you asap.
