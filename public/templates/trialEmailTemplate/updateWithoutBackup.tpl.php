Hey <?php echo $d['firstName']; ?>,<br><br>

Looks like someone's on a roll! You just saved hours of manual toiling, logging into individual websites and updating items all day long. That's so 2017. ðŸ˜‰ And you know what they say... Time is money. ðŸ’µ <br><br>

But I also noticed that you didn't backup your websites before updating them. I'm sure you know this is not a good idea. Updates can break your websites and it's handy to have latest backups to restore your websites from, you know. Just in case.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
