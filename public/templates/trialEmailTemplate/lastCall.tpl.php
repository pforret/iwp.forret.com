Hey <?php echo $d['firstName']; ?>,<br><br>

By midnight tonight, we will permanently delete your instance of IWP. If you would like to continue using it, you have to <b>move your panel</b> immediately.<br><br>

<a href="<?php echo SUPPORT_URL ?>solution/articles/235590-how-to-move-a-hosted-panel-to-your-server/?utm_source=trial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=last_call">See How to move my panel -></a><br><br>

It means a lot to me if you can spend 2 minutes to share you experience with your trial of InfiniteWP.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>

P.S.: As always, if you have any questions, just reply to this email and we'll get back to you asap.
