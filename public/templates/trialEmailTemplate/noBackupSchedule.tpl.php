Hey <?php echo $d['firstName']; ?>,<br><br>

Regularly backing up our websites is essential to safeguard them from threats. But it's a hassle to remember to back them up regularly. Thankfully, you don't have to. You can schedule backups to run Daily, Weekly, Every 2 weeks or monthly.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
David.<br><br>

P.S.: As always, if you have any questions, just reply to this email and we'll get back to you asap.
